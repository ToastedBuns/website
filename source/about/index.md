# About us
Welcome to Toasted Buns!
Making sure your buns are toasted for the greatest pleasure.
Creating social commentary on things we find worth talking about! I live in a police state called the United Kingdom, therefore I will try to focus on local issues the most!
We talk about absolutely anything on the podcast. Ranging from social commentary on Brexit, massive immigration to diet and Artifial Inteligence.

Podcast, blog and Youtube Channel!
Your feedback is greatly appreciated.

I love you all and you are the best!
