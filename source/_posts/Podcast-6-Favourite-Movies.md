![Favourite movies!](/images/movies.jpg)
This time we are talking about our favourite movies. Going through our 
Top 10 with some honourable mentions including Mad Max, Fight Club, The 
Matrix and many more!
<!--more-->
We wanted to have a more chill session this time talking about something 
we both really enjoy. We are toasting some more serious discussions, but 
I believe that you need to talk about something that is inspiring too!
We are still trying out new things and new formats, therefore your 
feedback is greatly appreciated!
I love you all and you are the best!<script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;"  data-ad-layout="in-article"  data-ad-format="fluid"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-2164900147810573"  data-ad-slot="8817307412"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script>
