![Transgender, what is it?](/images/transgender.png)
My first podcast recorded with Ahmed.
Talking about Transgender movement and it's implications for our society. Mass immigration into Europe from 3rd world countries, why it happened and what effect it will have.
Lastly, we discussed Brexit. The reasons behind it, will it actually happen and how the world will be affected by it.
It is our first Podcast, therefore, we are still polishing it up.
Your feedback is greatly appreciated!
I love you all and you are the best!

Thank you for listening!
