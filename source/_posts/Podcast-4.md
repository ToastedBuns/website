Fourth episode of our podcast! This time with a guest Jamie!
Talking about his experience of coming out as Bisexual, 3rd Wave Feminism and LBGQT+ community!
Really enjoyd this episode, because it was very light-hearted for the most part and really funny!
It is our fourth Podcast, therefore, we are still polishing it up.
Your feedback is greatly appreciated!
I love you all and you are the best!

Thank you for listening!
