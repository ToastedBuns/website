Episode 8 of Toasted Buns podcast. This time talking about Keto diet and how we are integrating a healthier diet and lifestyle into our lives. 
<!--more-->
Have you heard about Keto diet before? I recently started doing it and Ahmed has been doing it for almost a year!
Check out our experiences of being on this diet!
In addition to this, we also discuss good eating habbits, how to be more productive and how your diet can effect your mental health!

We are still trying out new things and new formats, therefore your 
feedback is greatly appreciated!
I love you all and you are the best!
