Trump is only enforcing these laws because the immigration rate from Mexico has skyrocketed in the last couple of years.

Human traffickers started using kids to get people across the border even easier...\nEven funnier is hearing Obama, Clinton, Bush and another leftist crying about this issue like they care about those kids at all. \"America is Nazi Germany!\" \"How can you listen to the crying kids and do nothing!\". These kinds of things are coming out from constantly. However, they are the ones who created these laws! In 2014, Hillary said, \"Just because your kids crossed the border it does not mean they will stay here\". Well, isn't that hypocritical of you?\nThe left keeps using the kids to gain even more power. Using our emotions to push their ideology and if we question it, we are called Nazis, bigots, white supremacists etc. Is it just me, or these words mean nothing now? Nevertheless, it's so annoying seeing them cry about these kids when they push the idea of having no children, funding abortions for women and incentifying single motherhood. Childless women like Hillary or Rachel Maddow cry on TV about these children, but they encourage women not to have them. YOU CAN'T HAVE BOTH!\nThese people are illegal immigrants. They deserve nothing. These children are used as objects to push for open borders. Stop complaining and build the damn wall. If America is so racist and bad, why do these people come here by thousands every day? There are official, legal ways to come into the USA and get asylum if needed. Mexico has borders, quite strict actually. Why are you not complaining about that? Please, just stop this nonsense and come back to reality. Trump is right when Mexico sends these people into the USA, they are not sending their best. Majority of these people will stay on welfare and will do nothing to help the native people. \nIn conclusion, can we just stop this bullcrap? Enough of these people crying on TV about how bad USA is. The United States of America is the greatest country on earth. And the only way to keep it this way is to make the borders even more difficult to cross.

The action was great and the whole movie felt like a great ride from start to finish. \nThe sequel is not.\n<!--more-->\nFirst of all, this movie introduces two new characters: A full-time activist who is also capable of performing extremely difficult surgeries on dinosaurs and an IT geek who is scared of absolutely everything. Both of them are lousy and unbearable. Chris Pratt and B.D. Howard returns as the leads and they are fine at best. The story of this movie is so pointless that it's not even worth discussing it. They are brought back into the island for absolutely no reason and they also bring those two new characters, even though they are utterly unprepared for this kind of journey.\nThe action is dull. No interesting set pieces and the direction is mediocre at best. The movie looks beautiful and the CGI is great, but the camera work is bland, every action scene involving humans is edited so much, that you can not see what is happening. CGI only scenes look pretty and are filmed a lot better.\nThe movie is too long and drags in the second act especially. Once the first act ends, the movie stops entirely. The characters do nothing and just stay on the ship for the next 30 minutes, while the main villains are introduced. I do not mind allocating time to flush out your villain, but the villains in this movie are so two-dimensional that it's a complete waste of time. The two main villains in this movie are even worse than the first movie so the whole second act feels slow, boring and unnecessary.\nUnfortunately, the third act does not save the film either. It has an interesting premise, but it reminds the previous movies too much and is kind of bland. Moreover, you are so tired of the tasteless story that you stop caring and the whole thing becomes a chore to sit through. Especially when the characters are boring and you do not care what happens to them.\nI want to come back to the two new characters before I finish. They are so unlikeable and drag the movie even more. The nerd character is such a manchild and majority of his scenes are just him screaming at everything. The activist girl is in the movie to only please feminists and to check a box that we have another strong female character. She does not really do anything besides that surgery.\nOverall, the movie is a disappointment. I went into the movie with very low expectations and still disappointed me. The story is bland, the pacing is horrible, actions scenes are boring and the characters are terrible.
