Lebron James led his teams to 8 straight (Heat and Cavaliers) NBA finals (which is impressive I have to admit) and met Mavericks, Thunder, Spurs (twice) and GSW (last 4 seasons). That means that in the last 8 years only 6 teams have played in the NBA finals. And only two in the last 4 years.\nWhen Kevin Durant decided to leave Oklahoma which was ahead of Golden State Warriors 3-1 in the Western Conference finals, before losing, and to join the same Golden State Warriors who defeated him I was mad. Everyone was mad. Everybody knew what this meant. Golden State Warriors will win the championship. And they did. And then we knew that they will win again. And they did. However, the Houston managed to put a fight, other teams were getting better so there was hope even though the excitement for NBA was dying.\nIt died today.\n<!--more-->\nThis morning I woke up to the news that another All-star Demarcus Cousins is joining the Warriors for basically a bag of peanuts ($5mln dollars for Cousins is a joke). Golden State Warriors now have a starting five which contains 5 all stars. This has not been done since 1970s when Celtics were dominating. 5 all-stars in the team. What the hell is going on?  What are we supposed to be excited about for the next season? Will the warriors lose at least once in the playoff? \nDemarcus Cousins is the biggest sellout I have ever seen. Even worse than Kevin Durant aka the snake. Cousins joined Pelicans and had a good team around him. He had Rondon, Holiday and Anthony Davis. He was part of a team that won 6th seed in the West and swept the blazers WITHOUT HIM. AD wore his jersey in the All-Star game to show his support for him. What does DC do after all of that? LEAVES TO GSW! Are you kidding me?! What happened to competitive nature of this sport? This has to be the most disrespectful move in NBA history. PATHETIC Demarcus. You are Pathetic.\n\tNBA is in big trouble. Adam Silver needs to do something drastic. This cannot continue anymore! I am so sick of seeing Golden State in the finals and it’s not stopping anytime soon. I don’t know how this can be fixed, but it has to be done. Adam Silver this is your time to shine. You need to come up with a way to stop these superteams. Put 500% tax for every $ that goes over the salary cap, that will stop those damn owners and GMs from overspending.\nIn addition to Golden State dominating for the last 4 years and the foreseeable future the East conference has been garbage for the last 20-30 years. And it is only getting worse every year. The MVP of the last 5 years is from the West. How telling is that? There has been 3 MVP winners from the East in the last 18 years. Iverson, Lebron and D Rose. That is it. And the last team to win NBA championship from the East that does not have Lebron James in the roster was Celtics in 2008. For the last 10 years it was either Lebron or the West. FIX IT NBA! \nI have been thinking about changing the play offs to be Top 16 teams of the regular season despite the conferences, but I don’t know if this drastic change is the right thing to do. The rich history of NBA will be altered forever. The rivalry between the conferences, even though it’s been weak for the last few decades, still has a great appeal for everyone. In addition to this, if no team from the East side of the USA makes the Finals, the appeal of NBA in half of the country will diminish.\nI love NBA. It is the best basketball league in the world with the best players. But what has been going on for the last ten years or so is unacceptable! This needs to be fixed now. NBA is in a desperate need of tough decisions from the executives and especially Mr. Silver. You inherited one of the greatest entertainment business in the world of sports from Mr. Stern. You will either make it better or it will be overtaken by other more competitive sports. The clock is ticking NBA and it is definitely not in your favour.\n","source":"_posts/NBA-is-in-big-trouble.md","raw":"---\ntitle: NBA is in big trouble\ndate: 2018-07-03 11:10:02\ntags:\n- NBA\n- Sports\n- Blog\n---\n![NBA is in a bad shape!](/images/nba.jpg)\nFor the last decade NBA has been receiving a lot of criticism for its lack of competitiveness.

Report also says<br>nearly 50,000 residents in the city cannot speak English. Diversity is<br>our strength, right?<br>","more":"<br>Massive immigration continues in Britain and the results are shocking.<br>There are thought to be residents from nearly 200 countries living in<br>Birmingham which has been described as ‘super diverse’ in the city<br>council’s new cohesion strategy. We are reaching new levels of<br>diversity. Super diverse cities are popping up all over the UK and<br>Europe. Of course, super diverse mean that white local residents are the<br>minority now. Even United States of America are projected to face the<br>same outcome. White Americans to become minority by 2044 thanks to<br>ageing population while Hispanics will make up a quarter of U.S.<br>citizens.<br>However, I will focus on Birmingham City in this blog. The mainstream<br>media has been talking about minorities being the victims in the UK for<br>years. However, even though White British people are not the majority<br>anymore in many cities in UK, minorities are still being treated as<br>victims. I love this quote from the article “Birmingham is soon to<br>become a majority minority city,” the report states. Majority minority<br>city? What does that mean? I thought that once minority overgrows the<br>majority of the population it becomes the new majority. Unfortunately,<br>the media will never say this, because that would show the reality of<br>mass uncontrolled immigration. Replacement of the population on a<br>massive scale. How does that make you feel?<br>Children from white families are in the minority in both Birmingham and<br>Leicester, according to researchers due to immigration. More than half<br>of those under 16 in the cities are now from black, Asian and other<br>ethnic communities, they believe. This was in 2011. It’s safe to say<br>that the difference has grown since. In addition to this, Birmingham<br>have more Muslim children than Christian. The figures show the number of<br>Muslim children in Birmingham is greater than the number who are<br>Christian for the first time, showing the city’s demographic shift. Of<br>Birmingham’s 278,623 children, 97,099 were registered as Muslim and<br>93,828 as Christian in the last census.<br>What will happen to British values once the majority is not British<br>White anymore? Will these people, who have no connection to Britain or<br>it’s culture, the people who come here to take advantage of the welfare<br>state, embrace British History and british values? Highly unlikely.<br>British people are starting to wake up from a deep sleep that lasted the<br>last 50 years. National identification is on the rise in the UK, but we<br>need to keep fighting. I was not born in Britain, but I grew up here. I<br>always admired the british values and would be devastated if it was<br>taken by foreign forces.<br>If you are British citizen or just love British values and cultures. Be<br>proud of it. Don’t be afraid to raise the St. George flag while eating<br>Sunday roast or fish and chips. Be proud of liberal values that Britain<br>helped to bring to the world.

There are laws that<br>prevent employers from paying their employees less based on gender,<br>women are encouraged to postpone settling down and creating a family for<br>career. Women are occupying top positions in biggest companies, like<br>Susan Wojcicki who is the CEO of Youtube or Kathleen Kennedy who is the<br>President of Lucasfilm. There are many different awards for women in<br>tech for example Business Journal’s 2017 Women in Technology Awards and<br>many more. Moreover, women have been appointed to many top positions in<br>politics too. Theresa May is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,<br>Dalia Grybauskaite has been the president of Lithuania since 2009 and<br>many more.<br>However, the mainstream media is still claiming that our society is a<br>sexist patriarchy that is working only in favour of men and women are a<br>marginalized minority. How true is that?<br>","more":"<br>Women in tech issue have been on the front pages of the news for years<br>now. For some reason, the mainstream media is pushing the narrative that<br>this industry is very sexist and more women need to get into the<br>industry. Even though women are more interested in people, not things<br>and prefer working in more humanitarian areas. Many tech companies are<br>trying so hard to meet the quotas that it is really getting out of hand.<br>One thing I do not understand is why men in the nursery are not<br>receiving even half of the attention that women in tech are? Majority of<br>teachers in early years schools are women. And it’s not 40/60 ratio. Oh<br>no no, 98% of teachers in the early years are women (This is in the UK,<br>might be different in other countries, but I would assume the majority<br>is still women). Where is the outrage of the Twitter mob about this<br>issue? Oh, the inequality only matters when women are the minority. I<br>suppose the oppressor cannot be the oppressed one. How convenient!<br>In addition to being a minority in some industries, men are faced with a<br>higher risk of dying at work. In 2017/18 96% (!!) of all fatal injuries<br>at work were to male workers. I am not advocating for any injuries at<br>all, because they are terrible, but why are we not talking about this<br>inequality? Oh, I guess men are the oppressors so they do not matter.<br>On the other hand, I do agree with 3rd wave feminists that some<br>industries are still dominated by men and that needs to change. A recent<br>LinkedIn analysis found that women make up just 26.7% of all oil and gas<br>industry profiles on the professional networking site. That is<br>unacceptable. I think that we should get that number to 50/50 and the<br>only way to do that is to send women to oil mining sites! This amazing<br>industry offers everything women love:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Terrible working environment</li>\n<li>Grave danger</li>\n<li>Going away from your family for a long time<br>And much more!<br>In addition to this, we should close the gender gap in other industries<br>too:</li>\n<li>Mail delivery</li>\n<li>Trash collection</li>\n<li>Mining</li>\n<li>Heavy-Duty Equipment Mechanics</li>\n<li>Bricklaying<br>Unfortunately, I do not see any campaigning or any protest against<br>companies in these industries to employ more women.
