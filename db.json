good](/images/women.jpg)\nWestern society has been working very hard to bridge the gap between men \nand women in workplaces for many decades now. There are laws that \nprevent employers from paying their employees less based on gender, \nwomen are encouraged to postpone settling down and creating a family for \ncareer. Women are occupying top positions in biggest companies, like \nSusan Wojcicki who is the CEO of Youtube or Kathleen Kennedy who is the \nPresident of Lucasfilm. There are many different awards for women in \ntech for example Business Journal's 2017 Women in Technology Awards and \nmany more. Moreover, women have been appointed to many top positions in \npolitics too. Theresa May is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, \nDalia Grybauskaite has been the president of Lithuania since 2009 and \nmany more.\nHowever, the mainstream media is still claiming that our society is a \nsexist patriarchy that is working only in favour of men and women are a \nmarginalized minority. How true is that?\n<!--more-->\nWomen in tech issue have been on the front pages of the news for years \nnow. For some reason, the mainstream media is pushing the narrative that \nthis industry is very sexist and more women need to get into the \nindustry. Even though women are more interested in people, not things \nand prefer working in more humanitarian areas. Many tech companies are \ntrying so hard to meet the quotas that it is really getting out of hand.\nOne thing I do not understand is why men in the nursery are not \nreceiving even half of the attention that women in tech are? Majority of \nteachers in early years schools are women. And it’s not 40/60 ratio. Oh \nno no, 98% of teachers in the early years are women (This is in the UK, \nmight be different in other countries, but I would assume the majority \nis still women). Where is the outrage of the Twitter mob about this \nissue? Oh, the inequality only matters when women are the minority. I \nsuppose the oppressor cannot be the oppressed one. How convenient!\nIn addition to being a minority in some industries, men are faced with a \nhigher risk of dying at work. In 2017/18 96% (!!) of all fatal injuries \nat work were to male workers. I am not advocating for any injuries at \nall, because they are terrible, but why are we not talking about this \ninequality? Oh, I guess men are the oppressors so they do not matter.\nOn the other hand, I do agree with 3rd wave feminists that some \nindustries are still dominated by men and that needs to change. A recent \nLinkedIn analysis found that women make up just 26.7% of all oil and gas \nindustry profiles on the professional networking site. That is \nunacceptable. I think that we should get that number to 50/50 and the \nonly way to do that is to send women to oil mining sites! This amazing \nindustry offers everything women love:\n* Terrible working environment\n* Grave danger\n* Going away from your family for a long time\nAnd much more!\nIn addition to this, we should close the gender gap in other industries \ntoo:\n* Mail delivery\n* Trash collection\n* Mining\n* Heavy-Duty Equipment Mechanics\n* Bricklaying\nUnfortunately, I do not see any campaigning or any protest against \ncompanies in these industries to employ more women. Maybe because these \njobs are hard, usually involve long hours and not the highest pay. I \nwonder why women only want to overtake Silicon Valley and CEO positions \nonly.\n    Lastly, I just want to ask one question about Women in Tech rewards. \nI recently received an invitation to nominate someone for one. But that \ngot me thinking! Using the logic of liberals, who say that anyone who \n‘believes that they are opposite gender’ is correct and should be \nrespected. Therefore my question is: “If I feel like a woman on \nWednesdays, can I apply for the Women in Tech award?”. I honestly do not \nknow the answer to this, but we have seen a transgender woman winning \nMiss Universe Award in Spain, and an activist who applied to be a \nwomen's officer for Labour party because he \"identifies as a woman on \nWednesdays.\" So why am I any different? Please let me know!\n    In the end, gender inequality is real. But is it a bad thing? Is it \nreally a result of evil patriarchy? Or is it a result of free will of \nthe people? The research is pointing to the fact that women, on average, \nprefer working with people. That is why majority of midwives, early \nschool teachers and nurses are women.

Again](/images/trump.jpg)\nHere we go again, calling Trump a Nazi.\nI am so sick of hearing this Mexican border hysteria from the left. \"Trump is ripping families apart!\", \"Trump is a Nazi!\", \"We care about children!\".\n<!--more-->\nFirst of all, the laws have been introduced by the democrats way before Trump came into power. Trump is only enforcing these laws because the immigration rate from Mexico has skyrocketed in the last couple of years. Mostly, because migrants coming into the US with children were let into the US without any trouble. Incentifying bad behaviour creates more bad behaviour! Human traffickers started using kids to get people across the border even easier...\nEven funnier is hearing Obama, Clinton, Bush and another leftist crying about this issue like they care about those kids at all. \"America is Nazi Germany!\" \"How can you listen to the crying kids and do nothing!\". These kinds of things are coming out from constantly. However, they are the ones who created these laws! In 2014, Hillary said, \"Just because your kids crossed the border it does not mean they will stay here\". Well, isn't that hypocritical of you?\nThe left keeps using the kids to gain even more power. Using our emotions to push their ideology and if we question it, we are called Nazis, bigots, white supremacists etc. Is it just me, or these words mean nothing now?

Lebron James led his teams to 8 straight (Heat and Cavaliers) NBA finals (which is impressive I have to admit) and met Mavericks, Thunder, Spurs (twice) and GSW (last 4 seasons). That means that in the last 8 years only 6 teams have played in the NBA finals. And only two in the last 4 years.\nWhen Kevin Durant decided to leave Oklahoma which was ahead of Golden State Warriors 3-1 in the Western Conference finals, before losing, and to join the same Golden State Warriors who defeated him I was mad. Everyone was mad. Everybody knew what this meant. Golden State Warriors will win the championship. And they did. And then we knew that they will win again. And they did. However, the Houston managed to put a fight, other teams were getting better so there was hope even though the excitement for NBA was dying.\nIt died today.\n<!--more-->\nThis morning I woke up to the news that another All-star Demarcus Cousins is joining the Warriors for basically a bag of peanuts ($5mln dollars for Cousins is a joke). Golden State Warriors now have a starting five which contains 5 all stars. This has not been done since 1970s when Celtics were dominating. 5 all-stars in the team. What the hell is going on?  What are we supposed to be excited about for the next season? Will the warriors lose at least once in the playoff? \nDemarcus Cousins is the biggest sellout I have ever seen. Even worse than Kevin Durant aka the snake. Cousins joined Pelicans and had a good team around him. He had Rondon, Holiday and Anthony Davis. He was part of a team that won 6th seed in the West and swept the blazers WITHOUT HIM. AD wore his jersey in the All-Star game to show his support for him. What does DC do after all of that? LEAVES TO GSW! Are you kidding me?! What happened to competitive nature of this sport? This has to be the most disrespectful move in NBA history. PATHETIC Demarcus. You are Pathetic.\n\tNBA is in big trouble. Adam Silver needs to do something drastic. This cannot continue anymore! I am so sick of seeing Golden State in the finals and it’s not stopping anytime soon. I don’t know how this can be fixed, but it has to be done. Adam Silver this is your time to shine. You need to come up with a way to stop these superteams. Put 500% tax for every $ that goes over the salary cap, that will stop those damn owners and GMs from overspending.\nIn addition to Golden State dominating for the last 4 years and the foreseeable future the East conference has been garbage for the last 20-30 years. And it is only getting worse every year. The MVP of the last 5 years is from the West. How telling is that? There has been 3 MVP winners from the East in the last 18 years. Iverson, Lebron and D Rose. That is it. And the last team to win NBA championship from the East that does not have Lebron James in the roster was Celtics in 2008. For the last 10 years it was either Lebron or the West. FIX IT NBA! \nI have been thinking about changing the play offs to be Top 16 teams of the regular season despite the conferences, but I don’t know if this drastic change is the right thing to do. The rich history of NBA will be altered forever. The rivalry between the conferences, even though it’s been weak for the last few decades, still has a great appeal for everyone. In addition to this, if no team from the East side of the USA makes the Finals, the appeal of NBA in half of the country will diminish.\nI love NBA. It is the best basketball league in the world with the best players. But what has been going on for the last ten years or so is unacceptable! This needs to be fixed now. NBA is in a desperate need of tough decisions from the executives and especially Mr. Silver. You inherited one of the greatest entertainment business in the world of sports from Mr. Stern. You will either make it better or it will be overtaken by other more competitive sports.

They are brought back into the island for absolutely no reason and they also bring those two new characters, even though they are utterly unprepared for this kind of journey.\nThe action is dull. No interesting set pieces and the direction is mediocre at best. The movie looks beautiful and the CGI is great, but the camera work is bland, every action scene involving humans is edited so much, that you can not see what is happening. CGI only scenes look pretty and are filmed a lot better.\nThe movie is too long and drags in the second act especially. Once the first act ends, the movie stops entirely. The characters do nothing and just stay on the ship for the next 30 minutes, while the main villains are introduced. I do not mind allocating time to flush out your villain, but the villains in this movie are so two-dimensional that it's a complete waste of time. The two main villains in this movie are even worse than the first movie so the whole second act feels slow, boring and unnecessary.\nUnfortunately, the third act does not save the film either. It has an interesting premise, but it reminds the previous movies too much and is kind of bland. Moreover, you are so tired of the tasteless story that you stop caring and the whole thing becomes a chore to sit through.

The activist girl is in the movie to only please feminists and to check a box that we have another strong female character. She does not really do anything besides that surgery.\nOverall, the movie is a disappointment. I went into the movie with very low expectations and still disappointed me.

When I \nwas a teenager, I’ve played Splinter Cell for the first time and I fell \nin love straight away. Splinter Cell introduced me to the genre of \nstealth and I’ve been a fan ever since. I like every single entry, even \nthough I have some issues with every game. I remember playing Splinter \nCell Double Agent all the time when I had an Xbox 360 and only have good \nmemories of the game. Therefore, I’ve decided to play it again and find \nout whether it still holds up.\n<!--more-->\nDouble Agent tried to do things differently and introduced the trust \nmechanics. You are playing as a double agent and you have to keep the \ntrust of NSA and JBA (Terrorist agency you have infiltrated). There are \ntimes where you have to make a decision that will only please one side, \nhowever, it is way too easy to keep both sides happy. In addition to \nthis, Double Agent introduces a set of levels where you need to spy \naround the headquarters of JBA. In these levels, you have a limited time \nto sneak around and collect more information about the terrorist and \ncomplete specific tasks from NSA. The catch here is that you are not \nallowed to attack anyone and you do not have any of your gadgets. The \nonly thing you have is your skills. It’s a good change of gameplay \nbetween levels and really is a lot of fun!\nThe graphics of the game was amazing for me when it came out. Sam looks \nbetter than ever, his model is very detailed and all the other main \ncharacters look distinct and realistic even today. However, there are \nsome areas of the game that do look really ugly. It feels like the game \nwas rushed a bit because the textures look low quality and the highly \ndetailed characters stand out way too much in poorly detailed \nenvironments. I’d say that the graphics are mediocre at best and just \nlook ugly at times. Again, does not hold up as well as other games.\nOn the other hand, the story is still excellent. You do feel like a \ndouble agent throughout the game. The villain is interesting, even \nthough a bit too two-dimensional. You have a variety of secondary \ncharacters and the setup of the story is still gripping. It’s \nunfortunate that Sam does not reflect on the events at the beginning of \nthe game throughout the game, but it does not ruin the experience. The \ngame has plenty of twists and turns that keep the momentum going. \nHowever, I feel like the story could be a bit longer to flesh out some \ncharacters and warp some loose ends. It even has multiple endings, \ntherefore playing it multiple times is really fun.\nThe gameplay is as good as ever. Sam has a variety of ways to sneak \naround, kill enemies and has a variety of gadgets to use. You have a \nnumber of ways to accomplish your objectives and you are not forced to \nchoose any style of gameplay. Secondary objectives return again and are \nreally fun to accomplish. I’ve mentioned the missions in the JBA \nheadquarters and they are a great addition to the Splinter Cell series.\nUnfortunately, the game is still very buggy. I played it on Steam with \nthe latest patch (I believe?) and it still had a load of issues. The \nphysics were all over the place at times, the graphics glitches were \nmore than noticeable and AI was really struggling to be realistic. There \nis a bug in the game, where if you do not set your walking speed to max \nyou cannot crack any safe. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? Moreover, after \nfinishing the last mission the game just froze and the only fix was to \nreduce the resolution! Wow, I honestly don’t remember this game being so \nbuggy, but maybe I was too young to notice or maybe my nostalgia for \nthis game overshadowed all the issues.\nOverall, does it still hold up? Not really, but it’s a great game \nnevertheless. If you have never played this game, I highly recommend \ngiving it a shot. It does not matter if you have played any of the \nSplinter Cell games or if you have are a fan of the series. I do not \nthink this is the best entry in the series, but it did introduce new \ntechniques to the mix and was a good experience! If you have never \nplayed a Splinter Cell game, I’d recommend starting with Chaos Theory, \nbecause it is easily the best game in the series and one of the best \ngames in the stealth genre.\n\n\n\n","source":"_posts/Review-Splinter-Cell-Double-Agent.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Review: Splinter Cell - Double Agent'\ndate: 2018-07-09 20:47:25\ntags:\n- Review\n- Splinter Cell\n- Video Games\n---\n![Does Splinter Cell Double Agent still hold \nup?](/images/splintercell.jpg)\nI’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for Splinter Cell series.

In addition to \nthis, Double Agent introduces a set of levels where you need to spy \naround the headquarters of JBA. In these levels, you have a limited time \nto sneak around and collect more information about the terrorist and \ncomplete specific tasks from NSA. The catch here is that you are not \nallowed to attack anyone and you do not have any of your gadgets. The \nonly thing you have is your skills. It’s a good change of gameplay \nbetween levels and really is a lot of fun!\nThe graphics of the game was amazing for me when it came out. Sam looks \nbetter than ever, his model is very detailed and all the other main \ncharacters look distinct and realistic even today. However, there are \nsome areas of the game that do look really ugly. It feels like the game \nwas rushed a bit because the textures look low quality and the highly \ndetailed characters stand out way too much in poorly detailed \nenvironments. I’d say that the graphics are mediocre at best and just \nlook ugly at times. Again, does not hold up as well as other games.\nOn the other hand, the story is still excellent. You do feel like a \ndouble agent throughout the game. The villain is interesting, even \nthough a bit too two-dimensional. You have a variety of secondary \ncharacters and the setup of the story is still gripping. It’s \nunfortunate that Sam does not reflect on the events at the beginning of \nthe game throughout the game, but it does not ruin the experience. The \ngame has plenty of twists and turns that keep the momentum going. \nHowever, I feel like the story could be a bit longer to flesh out some \ncharacters and warp some loose ends. It even has multiple endings, \ntherefore playing it multiple times is really fun.\nThe gameplay is as good as ever. Sam has a variety of ways to sneak \naround, kill enemies and has a variety of gadgets to use. You have a \nnumber of ways to accomplish your objectives and you are not forced to \nchoose any style of gameplay. Secondary objectives return again and are \nreally fun to accomplish. I’ve mentioned the missions in the JBA \nheadquarters and they are a great addition to the Splinter Cell series.\nUnfortunately, the game is still very buggy. I played it on Steam with \nthe latest patch (I believe?) and it still had a load of issues. The \nphysics were all over the place at times, the graphics glitches were \nmore than noticeable and AI was really struggling to be realistic. There \nis a bug in the game, where if you do not set your walking speed to max \nyou cannot crack any safe. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? Moreover, after \nfinishing the last mission the game just froze and the only fix was to \nreduce the resolution! Wow, I honestly don’t remember this game being so \nbuggy, but maybe I was too young to notice or maybe my nostalgia for \nthis game overshadowed all the issues.\nOverall, does it still hold up? Not really, but it’s a great game \nnevertheless. If you have never played this game, I highly recommend \ngiving it a shot. It does not matter if you have played any of the \nSplinter Cell games or if you have are a fan of the series. I do not \nthink this is the best entry in the series, but it did introduce new \ntechniques to the mix and was a good experience! If you have never \nplayed a Splinter Cell game, I’d recommend starting with Chaos Theory, \nbecause it is easily the best game in the series and one of the best \ngames in the stealth genre.\n\n\n\n","slug":"Review-Splinter-Cell-Double-Agent","published":1,"updated":"2018-07-11T13:44:10.994Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjjh6wl7u000g0jjka0v53axh","content":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" class=\"aplayer-secondary-style-marker\" href=\"/assets/css/APlayer.min.css\"><script src=\"/assets/js/APlayer.min.js\" class=\"aplayer-secondary-script-marker\"></script><p><img src=\"/images/splintercell.jpg\" alt=\"Does Splinter Cell Double Agent still hold \nup?\"><br>I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for Splinter Cell series.

Unfortunately, in reality, this is a betrayal of all Brexit voters and will bring an end to Theresa May and Conservative party.\n<!--more-->\nFirst of all, throwing away the option of no deal was a huge mistake by Theresa May and her team. They lost all bargaining power at the very start and it made the negotiations even more difficult for the UK. Brussel’s have no fear of having no deal and will use this to make a terrible deal for the UK. Remember, the EU wants to make an example for other EU nations thinking about leaving the EU because if UK ends up being even better after leaving the EU, many countries will recess the idea of staying in the EU. Especially Poland, Hungary, Austria and Italy. The relationship between these countries and the EU have been a tough one, to say the least in the recent years and EU’s policy for massive immigration only increased the resentment of these countries against the EU.\nSecondly, this deal struck at Chequers is a complete betrayal of the voters who voted in the referendum. Th. May have been saying “Brexit means Brexit” for almost two years now and she comes up with this? If you are not familiar with the proposal, I will go over the most important points in this blog. Many Brexit supporters in the Conservative party have been very vocal about this deal, especially Jacob Rees-Mogg who, in my opinion, should be leading the conservative party after Th. May is gone. Moreover, chief Brexit negotiator David Davis has resigned because of this agreement saying “we are giving away too much, too easily”. Right after him Boris Johnson, the Foreign Secretary resigned as well, saying that \"Brexit should be about opportunity and hope” and. \"That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.\"  Could not agree more!\nNow let’s look into the actual deal that Th. May agreed with her cabinet. Starting with free movement. The government will try to end the free movement, however, the paper says that “include a mobility framework so that UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other’s territories, and apply for study and work”. In reality, it is just the same free movement in the EU, just named differently. All those people who voted for retaking the control of our borders must be really excited!\nNext point is Remaining in the EU customs union. This means that the UK will continue to follow EU rules on trading goods to remove the need for customs checks and controls between the UK and the EU. The United Kingdom will not be able to impose its own tariffs and will have to stay in check with the EU. This will definitely not going to help in negotiating trading deals with the United States and Donald Trump already reflected on this, saying that, “Theresa May's Brexit plan will 'kill' US trade deal”. Absolute disaster for the UK, which will need good trading deals with countries outside the EU and the US was willing to do trade until this plan was introduced.\nMoreover, the UK agrees to follow EU law if parliament agrees. But let’s be honest, the parliament will approve every law from the EU to make sure that the EU is happy. This is the main reason why David Davis resigned, saying “That means the European Union writes the rule for us in effect and we have to harmonise, we have the same rules for intents and purposes”. Moreover, the European Court will still be above UK courts, therefore any disputes will be decided by the European Court of Justice!\nIf this deal goes through, the United Kingdom will become a vessel state in the European Union. It will have to follow all the rules and regulations the European Union creates but will have no say in creating them. It’s ironic to hear EU leaders calling Hungary authoritarian when they act in this way. The EU is purposely punishing the United Kingdom for leaving the EU and that is absolutely disgusting. EU was supposed to be a free union, but it is turning into EUSSR by centralising more and more power into its hands and ignoring the democratic vote of the people in the United Kingdom.\nIn conclusion, Theresa May should not have been appointed as a PM after the Brexit referendum because she was a Remainer. She never wanted to leave and has been delaying the Brexit since the beginning. It is time for a change in the leadership of the Conservative party before it is too late. I am hoping that Jacob Reeg-Moss will become the new Prime Minister of the UK, but it is unlikely. Currently, the media is saying that Boris Johnson has the highest chance of replacing Theresa May. I am still sceptical of Boris Johnson because of his terrible time as the mayor of London, but it’s time for a change!\n\n\n","source":"_posts/Brexit-Deal.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Chequers Brexit plan is the final nail in the coffin for Theresa May'\ndate: 2018-07-14 16:42:17\ntags:\n- Britain\n- Immigration\n- Blog\n- Brexit\n---\n![England values are at risk](/images/theresamay.jpg)\nPrime Minister Theresa May celebrated the Brexit drawing hammered at Chequers as a step towards achieving the best result for Britain's future security and prosperity.
