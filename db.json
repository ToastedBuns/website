minority in Birmingham ","date":"2018-06-30T12:30:45.000Z","_content":"![England values are at risk](/images/britishlads.jpg)\nBirmingham joins London, Leicester, Luton and Slough. Report also says \nnearly 50,000 residents in the city cannot speak English. Diversity is \nour strength, right?\n<!--more-->\nMassive immigration continues in Britain and the results are shocking. \nThere are thought to be residents from nearly 200 countries living in \nBirmingham which has been described as 'super diverse' in the city \ncouncil's new cohesion strategy. We are reaching new levels of \ndiversity. Super diverse cities are popping up all over the UK and \nEurope. Of course, super diverse mean that white local residents are the \nminority now. Even United States of America are projected to face the \nsame outcome. White Americans to become minority by 2044 thanks to \nageing population while Hispanics will make up a quarter of U.S. \ncitizens.\nHowever, I will focus on Birmingham City in this blog. The mainstream \nmedia has been talking about minorities being the victims in the UK for \nyears. However, even though White British people are not the majority \nanymore in many cities in UK, minorities are still being treated as \nvictims. I love this quote from the article \"Birmingham is soon to \nbecome a majority minority city,\" the report states. Majority minority \ncity? What does that mean? I thought that once minority overgrows the \nmajority of the population it becomes the new majority. Unfortunately, \nthe media will never say this, because that would show the reality of \nmass uncontrolled immigration. Replacement of the population on a \nmassive scale. How does that make you feel?\nChildren from white families are in the minority in both Birmingham and \nLeicester, according to researchers due to immigration. More than half \nof those under 16 in the cities are now from black, Asian and other \nethnic communities, they believe. This was in 2011. It’s safe to say \nthat the difference has grown since. In addition to this, Birmingham \nhave more Muslim children than Christian. The figures show the number of \nMuslim children in Birmingham is greater than the number who are \nChristian for the first time, showing the city's demographic shift. Of \nBirmingham's 278,623 children, 97,099 were registered as Muslim and \n93,828 as Christian in the last census. \nWhat will happen to British values once the majority is not British \nWhite anymore? Will these people, who have no connection to Britain or \nit’s culture, the people who come here to take advantage of the welfare \nstate, embrace British History and british values? Highly unlikely. \nBritish people are starting to wake up from a deep sleep that lasted the \nlast 50 years. National identification is on the rise in the UK, but we \nneed to keep fighting. I was not born in Britain, but I grew up here. I \nalways admired the british values and would be devastated if it was \ntaken by foreign forces.\nIf you are British citizen or just love British values and cultures. Be \nproud of it.

I love this quote from the article \"Birmingham is soon to \nbecome a majority minority city,\" the report states. Majority minority \ncity? What does that mean? I thought that once minority overgrows the \nmajority of the population it becomes the new majority.

How does that make you feel?\nChildren from white families are in the minority in both Birmingham and \nLeicester, according to researchers due to immigration. More than half \nof those under 16 in the cities are now from black, Asian and other \nethnic communities, they believe. This was in 2011. It’s safe to say \nthat the difference has grown since. In addition to this, Birmingham \nhave more Muslim children than Christian. The figures show the number of \nMuslim children in Birmingham is greater than the number who are \nChristian for the first time, showing the city's demographic shift. Of \nBirmingham's 278,623 children, 97,099 were registered as Muslim and \n93,828 as Christian in the last census. \nWhat will happen to British values once the majority is not British \nWhite anymore? Will these people, who have no connection to Britain or \nit’s culture, the people who come here to take advantage of the welfare \nstate, embrace British History and british values? Highly unlikely. \nBritish people are starting to wake up from a deep sleep that lasted the \nlast 50 years. National identification is on the rise in the UK, but we \nneed to keep fighting. I was not born in Britain, but I grew up here. I \nalways admired the british values and would be devastated if it was \ntaken by foreign forces.\nIf you are British citizen or just love British values and cultures. Be \nproud of it. Don’t be afraid to raise the St. George flag while eating \nSunday roast or fish and chips. Be proud of liberal values that Britain \nhelped to bring to the world.

Lebron James led his teams to 8 straight (Heat and Cavaliers) NBA finals (which is impressive I have to admit) and met Mavericks, Thunder, Spurs (twice) and GSW (last 4 seasons). That means that in the last 8 years only 6 teams have played in the NBA finals. And only two in the last 4 years.\nWhen Kevin Durant decided to leave Oklahoma which was ahead of Golden State Warriors 3-1 in the Western Conference finals, before losing, and to join the same Golden State Warriors who defeated him I was mad. Everyone was mad. Everybody knew what this meant. Golden State Warriors will win the championship. And they did. And then we knew that they will win again. And they did. However, the Houston managed to put a fight, other teams were getting better so there was hope even though the excitement for NBA was dying.\nIt died today.\n<!--more-->\nThis morning I woke up to the news that another All-star Demarcus Cousins is joining the Warriors for basically a bag of peanuts ($5mln dollars for Cousins is a joke). Golden State Warriors now have a starting five which contains 5 all stars. This has not been done since 1970s when Celtics were dominating. 5 all-stars in the team. What the hell is going on?  What are we supposed to be excited about for the next season? Will the warriors lose at least once in the playoff? \nDemarcus Cousins is the biggest sellout I have ever seen. Even worse than Kevin Durant aka the snake. Cousins joined Pelicans and had a good team around him. He had Rondon, Holiday and Anthony Davis. He was part of a team that won 6th seed in the West and swept the blazers WITHOUT HIM. AD wore his jersey in the All-Star game to show his support for him. What does DC do after all of that? LEAVES TO GSW! Are you kidding me?! What happened to competitive nature of this sport? This has to be the most disrespectful move in NBA history. PATHETIC Demarcus. You are Pathetic.\n\tNBA is in big trouble. Adam Silver needs to do something drastic. This cannot continue anymore! I am so sick of seeing Golden State in the finals and it’s not stopping anytime soon. I don’t know how this can be fixed, but it has to be done. Adam Silver this is your time to shine. You need to come up with a way to stop these superteams. Put 500% tax for every $ that goes over the salary cap, that will stop those damn owners and GMs from overspending.\nIn addition to Golden State dominating for the last 4 years and the foreseeable future the East conference has been garbage for the last 20-30 years. And it is only getting worse every year. The MVP of the last 5 years is from the West. How telling is that? There has been 3 MVP winners from the East in the last 18 years. Iverson, Lebron and D Rose. That is it. And the last team to win NBA championship from the East that does not have Lebron James in the roster was Celtics in 2008. For the last 10 years it was either Lebron or the West. FIX IT NBA! \nI have been thinking about changing the play offs to be Top 16 teams of the regular season despite the conferences, but I don’t know if this drastic change is the right thing to do. The rich history of NBA will be altered forever. The rivalry between the conferences, even though it’s been weak for the last few decades, still has a great appeal for everyone. In addition to this, if no team from the East side of the USA makes the Finals, the appeal of NBA in half of the country will diminish.\nI love NBA. It is the best basketball league in the world with the best players. But what has been going on for the last ten years or so is unacceptable! This needs to be fixed now. NBA is in a desperate need of tough decisions from the executives and especially Mr. Silver. You inherited one of the greatest entertainment business in the world of sports from Mr. Stern. You will either make it better or it will be overtaken by other more competitive sports. The clock is ticking NBA and it is definitely not in your favour.\n","source":"_posts/NBA-is-in-big-trouble.md","raw":"---\ntitle: NBA is in big trouble\ndate: 2018-07-03 11:10:02\ntags:\n- NBA\n- Sports\n- Blog\n---\n![NBA is in a bad shape!](/images/nba.jpg)\nFor the last decade NBA has been receiving a lot of criticism for its lack of competitiveness.

Put 500% tax for every $ that goes over the salary cap, that will stop those damn owners and GMs from overspending.\nIn addition to Golden State dominating for the last 4 years and the foreseeable future the East conference has been garbage for the last 20-30 years. And it is only getting worse every year. The MVP of the last 5 years is from the West. How telling is that? There has been 3 MVP winners from the East in the last 18 years. Iverson, Lebron and D Rose. That is it. And the last team to win NBA championship from the East that does not have Lebron James in the roster was Celtics in 2008. For the last 10 years it was either Lebron or the West. FIX IT NBA! \nI have been thinking about changing the play offs to be Top 16 teams of the regular season despite the conferences, but I don’t know if this drastic change is the right thing to do. The rich history of NBA will be altered forever. The rivalry between the conferences, even though it’s been weak for the last few decades, still has a great appeal for everyone. In addition to this, if no team from the East side of the USA makes the Finals, the appeal of NBA in half of the country will diminish.\nI love NBA. It is the best basketball league in the world with the best players. But what has been going on for the last ten years or so is unacceptable! This needs to be fixed now. NBA is in a desperate need of tough decisions from the executives and especially Mr. Silver. You inherited one of the greatest entertainment business in the world of sports from Mr. Stern. You will either make it better or it will be overtaken by other more competitive sports. The clock is ticking NBA and it is definitely not in your favour.\n","slug":"NBA-is-in-big-trouble","published":1,"updated":"2018-07-03T17:24:31.867Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjj8ueeik000404vxki2tv1rk","content":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" class=\"aplayer-secondary-style-marker\" href=\"\\assets\\css\\APlayer.min.css\"><script src=\"\\assets\\js\\APlayer.min.js\" class=\"aplayer-secondary-script-marker\"></script><p><img src=\"/images/nba.jpg\" alt=\"NBA is in a bad shape!\"><br>For the last decade NBA has been receiving a lot of criticism for its lack of competitiveness.

Anthony Kennedy is retiring and Trump will have an opportunity to put another Conservative Judge into Supreme Court. This will give Conservatives 5-4 majority and this is huge. Mr Kennedy has been overturning a lot of cases in favour of the left. One of the cases was Roe vs Wade in 1973 regarding abortion. With Mr Kennedy leaving, this decision will probably be overturned and the issue of abortion will be reconsidered again. I highly doubt abortion will be banned (Which a lot of conservatives would like). Personally, I think abortion must be allowed if the mother is in danger for her life and maybe at the very early stages of pregnancy. I have not made up my mind completely at this point, because I have seen good arguments from both sides.\nWhat I find really funny about this story, is that the Democrats and mains stream media in America has completely forgotten about the children they were crying every day on live television and is only talking about the end of democracy at the US because this judge has retired. Feels like the left never really cared about those kids anyway and just used them for power like they always do.

Bayona\nWriters: Derek Connolly, Colin Trevorrow\nStars: Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rafe Spall \nI am not a hardcore fan of Jurassic Park series, but I do love the first movie and I really enjoyed the first Jurrasic World film. Chris Pratt was a great lead as always and his co-star Bryce Dallas Howard was likeable enough. The action was great and the whole movie felt like a great ride from start to finish. \nThe sequel is not.\n<!--more-->\nFirst of all, this movie introduces two new characters: A full-time activist who is also capable of performing extremely difficult surgeries on dinosaurs and an IT geek who is scared of absolutely everything. Both of them are lousy and unbearable. Chris Pratt and B.D. Howard returns as the leads and they are fine at best. The story of this movie is so pointless that it's not even worth discussing it. They are brought back into the island for absolutely no reason and they also bring those two new characters, even though they are utterly unprepared for this kind of journey.\nThe action is dull. No interesting set pieces and the direction is mediocre at best. The movie looks beautiful and the CGI is great, but the camera work is bland, every action scene involving humans is edited so much, that you can not see what is happening. CGI only scenes look pretty and are filmed a lot better.\nThe movie is too long and drags in the second act especially. Once the first act ends, the movie stops entirely. The characters do nothing and just stay on the ship for the next 30 minutes, while the main villains are introduced. I do not mind allocating time to flush out your villain, but the villains in this movie are so two-dimensional that it's a complete waste of time. The two main villains in this movie are even worse than the first movie so the whole second act feels slow, boring and unnecessary.\nUnfortunately, the third act does not save the film either. It has an interesting premise, but it reminds the previous movies too much and is kind of bland. Moreover, you are so tired of the tasteless story that you stop caring and the whole thing becomes a chore to sit through. Especially when the characters are boring and you do not care what happens to them.\nI want to come back to the two new characters before I finish. They are so unlikeable and drag the movie even more. The nerd character is such a manchild and majority of his scenes are just him screaming at everything. The activist girl is in the movie to only please feminists and to check a box that we have another strong female character. She does not really do anything besides that surgery.\nOverall, the movie is a disappointment. I went into the movie with very low expectations and still disappointed me. The story is bland, the pacing is horrible, actions scenes are boring and the characters are terrible. There is nothing redeemable about this film and it deserves to be forgotten.\n3/10","source":"_posts/Review-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Review: Jurassic World - The Fallen Kingdom'\ndate: 2018-06-22 17:07:24\ntags:\n- Review\n- Movies\n- Jurrasic World\n---\n![What is the point of this?](/images/jurassic-world.jpg)\nDirector: J.A.
