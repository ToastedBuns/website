minority in Birmingham ","date":"2018-06-30T12:30:45.000Z","_content":"![England values are at risk](/images/britishlads.jpg)\nBirmingham joins London, Leicester, Luton and Slough. Report also says \nnearly 50,000 residents in the city cannot speak English. Diversity is \nour strength, right?\n<!--more-->\nMassive immigration continues in Britain and the results are shocking. \nThere are thought to be residents from nearly 200 countries living in \nBirmingham which has been described as 'super diverse' in the city \ncouncil's new cohesion strategy. We are reaching new levels of \ndiversity. Super diverse cities are popping up all over the UK and \nEurope. Of course, super diverse mean that white local residents are the \nminority now. Even United States of America are projected to face the \nsame outcome. White Americans to become minority by 2044 thanks to \nageing population while Hispanics will make up a quarter of U.S. \ncitizens.\nHowever, I will focus on Birmingham City in this blog. The mainstream \nmedia has been talking about minorities being the victims in the UK for \nyears. However, even though White British people are not the majority \nanymore in many cities in UK, minorities are still being treated as \nvictims. I love this quote from the article \"Birmingham is soon to \nbecome a majority minority city,\" the report states. Majority minority \ncity? What does that mean? I thought that once minority overgrows the \nmajority of the population it becomes the new majority. Unfortunately, \nthe media will never say this, because that would show the reality of \nmass uncontrolled immigration. Replacement of the population on a \nmassive scale.

Bayona\nWriters: Derek Connolly, Colin Trevorrow\nStars: Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rafe Spall \nI am not a hardcore fan of Jurassic Park series, but I do love the first movie and I really enjoyed the first Jurrasic World film. Chris Pratt was a great lead as always and his co-star Bryce Dallas Howard was likeable enough. The action was great and the whole movie felt like a great ride from start to finish. \nThe sequel is not.\n<!--more-->\nFirst of all, this movie introduces two new characters: A full-time activist who is also capable of performing extremely difficult surgeries on dinosaurs and an IT geek who is scared of absolutely everything. Both of them are lousy and unbearable. Chris Pratt and B.D. Howard returns as the leads and they are fine at best. The story of this movie is so pointless that it's not even worth discussing it. They are brought back into the island for absolutely no reason and they also bring those two new characters, even though they are utterly unprepared for this kind of journey.\nThe action is dull. No interesting set pieces and the direction is mediocre at best. The movie looks beautiful and the CGI is great, but the camera work is bland, every action scene involving humans is edited so much, that you can not see what is happening. CGI only scenes look pretty and are filmed a lot better.\nThe movie is too long and drags in the second act especially. Once the first act ends, the movie stops entirely. The characters do nothing and just stay on the ship for the next 30 minutes, while the main villains are introduced. I do not mind allocating time to flush out your villain, but the villains in this movie are so two-dimensional that it's a complete waste of time. The two main villains in this movie are even worse than the first movie so the whole second act feels slow, boring and unnecessary.\nUnfortunately, the third act does not save the film either. It has an interesting premise, but it reminds the previous movies too much and is kind of bland. Moreover, you are so tired of the tasteless story that you stop caring and the whole thing becomes a chore to sit through. Especially when the characters are boring and you do not care what happens to them.\nI want to come back to the two new characters before I finish. They are so unlikeable and drag the movie even more. The nerd character is such a manchild and majority of his scenes are just him screaming at everything. The activist girl is in the movie to only please feminists and to check a box that we have another strong female character. She does not really do anything besides that surgery.\nOverall, the movie is a disappointment. I went into the movie with very low expectations and still disappointed me. The story is bland, the pacing is horrible, actions scenes are boring and the characters are terrible. There is nothing redeemable about this film and it deserves to be forgotten.\n3/10","source":"_posts/Review-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Review: Jurassic World - The Fallen Kingdom'\ndate: 2018-06-22 17:07:24\ntags:\n- Review\n- Movies\n- Jurrasic World\n---\n![What is the point of this?](/images/jurassic-world.jpg)\nDirector: J.A.

No interesting set pieces and the direction is mediocre at best. The movie looks beautiful and the CGI is great, but the camera work is bland, every action scene involving humans is edited so much, that you can not see what is happening. CGI only scenes look pretty and are filmed a lot better.\nThe movie is too long and drags in the second act especially. Once the first act ends, the movie stops entirely. The characters do nothing and just stay on the ship for the next 30 minutes, while the main villains are introduced. I do not mind allocating time to flush out your villain, but the villains in this movie are so two-dimensional that it's a complete waste of time. The two main villains in this movie are even worse than the first movie so the whole second act feels slow, boring and unnecessary.\nUnfortunately, the third act does not save the film either. It has an interesting premise, but it reminds the previous movies too much and is kind of bland. Moreover, you are so tired of the tasteless story that you stop caring and the whole thing becomes a chore to sit through. Especially when the characters are boring and you do not care what happens to them.\nI want to come back to the two new characters before I finish. They are so unlikeable and drag the movie even more. The nerd character is such a manchild and majority of his scenes are just him screaming at everything. The activist girl is in the movie to only please feminists and to check a box that we have another strong female character. She does not really do anything besides that surgery.\nOverall, the movie is a disappointment. I went into the movie with very low expectations and still disappointed me. The story is bland, the pacing is horrible, actions scenes are boring and the characters are terrible. There is nothing redeemable about this film and it deserves to be forgotten.\n3/10","slug":"Review-Jurassic-World-Fallen-Kingdom","published":1,"updated":"2018-06-22T16:48:24.520Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cjj1eavf50008asvxmsuf5b8w","content":"<link rel=\"stylesheet\" class=\"aplayer-secondary-style-marker\" href=\"\\assets\\css\\APlayer.min.css\"><script src=\"\\assets\\js\\APlayer.min.js\" class=\"aplayer-secondary-script-marker\"></script><p><img src=\"/images/jurassic-world.jpg\" alt=\"What is the point of this?\"><br>Director: J.A.
