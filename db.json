I love this quote from the article \"Birmingham is soon to \nbecome a majority minority city,\" the report states. Majority minority \ncity? What does that mean? I thought that once minority overgrows the \nmajority of the population it becomes the new majority.

How does that make you feel?\nChildren from white families are in the minority in both Birmingham and \nLeicester, according to researchers due to immigration.

The figures show the number of \nMuslim children in Birmingham is greater than the number who are \nChristian for the first time, showing the city's demographic shift. Of \nBirmingham's 278,623 children, 97,099 were registered as Muslim and \n93,828 as Christian in the last census. \nWhat will happen to British values once the majority is not British \nWhite anymore? Will these people, who have no connection to Britain or \nit’s culture, the people who come here to take advantage of the welfare \nstate, embrace British History and british values?

Don’t be afraid to raise the St. George flag while eating \nSunday roast or fish and chips. Be proud of liberal values that Britain \nhelped to bring to the world.

When I \nwas a teenager, I’ve played Splinter Cell for the first time and I fell \nin love straight away. Splinter Cell introduced me to the genre of \nstealth and I’ve been a fan ever since. I like every single entry, even \nthough I have some issues with every game. I remember playing Splinter \nCell Double Agent all the time when I had an Xbox 360 and only have good \nmemories of the game. Therefore, I’ve decided to play it again and find \nout whether it still holds up.\n<!--more-->\nDouble Agent tried to do things differently and introduced the trust \nmechanics. You are playing as a double agent and you have to keep the \ntrust of NSA and JBA (Terrorist agency you have infiltrated). There are \ntimes where you have to make a decision that will only please one side, \nhowever, it is way too easy to keep both sides happy. In addition to \nthis, Double Agent introduces a set of levels where you need to spy \naround the headquarters of JBA. In these levels, you have a limited time \nto sneak around and collect more information about the terrorist and \ncomplete specific tasks from NSA. The catch here is that you are not \nallowed to attack anyone and you do not have any of your gadgets. The \nonly thing you have is your skills. It’s a good change of gameplay \nbetween levels and really is a lot of fun!\nThe graphics of the game was amazing for me when it came out. Sam looks \nbetter than ever, his model is very detailed and all the other main \ncharacters look distinct and realistic even today. However, there are \nsome areas of the game that do look really ugly. It feels like the game \nwas rushed a bit because the textures look low quality and the highly \ndetailed characters stand out way too much in poorly detailed \nenvironments. I’d say that the graphics are mediocre at best and just \nlook ugly at times. Again, does not hold up as well as other games.\nOn the other hand, the story is still excellent. You do feel like a \ndouble agent throughout the game. The villain is interesting, even \nthough a bit too two-dimensional. You have a variety of secondary \ncharacters and the setup of the story is still gripping. It’s \nunfortunate that Sam does not reflect on the events at the beginning of \nthe game throughout the game, but it does not ruin the experience. The \ngame has plenty of twists and turns that keep the momentum going. \nHowever, I feel like the story could be a bit longer to flesh out some \ncharacters and warp some loose ends. It even has multiple endings, \ntherefore playing it multiple times is really fun.\nThe gameplay is as good as ever. Sam has a variety of ways to sneak \naround, kill enemies and has a variety of gadgets to use. You have a \nnumber of ways to accomplish your objectives and you are not forced to \nchoose any style of gameplay. Secondary objectives return again and are \nreally fun to accomplish. I’ve mentioned the missions in the JBA \nheadquarters and they are a great addition to the Splinter Cell series.\nUnfortunately, the game is still very buggy. I played it on Steam with \nthe latest patch (I believe?) and it still had a load of issues. The \nphysics were all over the place at times, the graphics glitches were \nmore than noticeable and AI was really struggling to be realistic. There \nis a bug in the game, where if you do not set your walking speed to max \nyou cannot crack any safe. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? Moreover, after \nfinishing the last mission the game just froze and the only fix was to \nreduce the resolution! Wow, I honestly don’t remember this game being so \nbuggy, but maybe I was too young to notice or maybe my nostalgia for \nthis game overshadowed all the issues.\nOverall, does it still hold up? Not really, but it’s a great game \nnevertheless. If you have never played this game, I highly recommend \ngiving it a shot. It does not matter if you have played any of the \nSplinter Cell games or if you have are a fan of the series. I do not \nthink this is the best entry in the series, but it did introduce new \ntechniques to the mix and was a good experience! If you have never \nplayed a Splinter Cell game, I’d recommend starting with Chaos Theory, \nbecause it is easily the best game in the series and one of the best \ngames in the stealth genre.\n\n\n\n","source":"_posts/Review-Splinter-Cell-Double-Agent.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Review: Splinter Cell - Double Agent'\ndate: 2018-07-09 20:47:25\ntags:\n- Review\n- Splinter Cell\n- Video Games\n---\n![Does Splinter Cell Double Agent still hold \nup?](/images/splintercell.jpg)\nI’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for Splinter Cell series.

You do feel like a<br>double agent throughout the game. The villain is interesting, even<br>though a bit too two-dimensional. You have a variety of secondary<br>characters and the setup of the story is still gripping. It’s<br>unfortunate that Sam does not reflect on the events at the beginning of<br>the game throughout the game, but it does not ruin the experience. The<br>game has plenty of twists and turns that keep the momentum going.<br>However, I feel like the story could be a bit longer to flesh out some<br>characters and warp some loose ends. It even has multiple endings,<br>therefore playing it multiple times is really fun.<br>The gameplay is as good as ever. Sam has a variety of ways to sneak<br>around, kill enemies and has a variety of gadgets to use. You have a<br>number of ways to accomplish your objectives and you are not forced to<br>choose any style of gameplay. Secondary objectives return again and are<br>really fun to accomplish. I’ve mentioned the missions in the JBA<br>headquarters and they are a great addition to the Splinter Cell series.<br>Unfortunately, the game is still very buggy. I played it on Steam with<br>the latest patch (I believe?) and it still had a load of issues. The<br>physics were all over the place at times, the graphics glitches were<br>more than noticeable and AI was really struggling to be realistic. There<br>is a bug in the game, where if you do not set your walking speed to max<br>you cannot crack any safe. HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? Moreover, after<br>finishing the last mission the game just froze and the only fix was to<br>reduce the resolution! Wow, I honestly don’t remember this game being so<br>buggy, but maybe I was too young to notice or maybe my nostalgia for<br>this game overshadowed all the issues.<br>Overall, does it still hold up? Not really, but it’s a great game<br>nevertheless. If you have never played this game, I highly recommend<br>giving it a shot. It does not matter if you have played any of the<br>Splinter Cell games or if you have are a fan of the series. I do not<br>think this is the best entry in the series, but it did introduce new<br>techniques to the mix and was a good experience! If you have never<br>played a Splinter Cell game, I’d recommend starting with Chaos Theory,<br>because it is easily the best game in the series and one of the best<br>games in the stealth genre.</p>"},{"title":"Review: Jurassic World - The Fallen Kingdom","date":"2018-06-22T16:07:24.000Z","_content":"![What is the point of this?](/images/jurassic-world.jpg)\nDirector: J.A.

Lebron James led his teams to 8 straight (Heat and Cavaliers) NBA finals (which is impressive I have to admit) and met Mavericks, Thunder, Spurs (twice) and GSW (last 4 seasons). That means that in the last 8 years only 6 teams have played in the NBA finals. And only two in the last 4 years.\nWhen Kevin Durant decided to leave Oklahoma which was ahead of Golden State Warriors 3-1 in the Western Conference finals, before losing, and to join the same Golden State Warriors who defeated him I was mad. Everyone was mad. Everybody knew what this meant. Golden State Warriors will win the championship. And they did. And then we knew that they will win again. And they did. However, the Houston managed to put a fight, other teams were getting better so there was hope even though the excitement for NBA was dying.\nIt died today.\n<!--more-->\nThis morning I woke up to the news that another All-star Demarcus Cousins is joining the Warriors for basically a bag of peanuts ($5mln dollars for Cousins is a joke). Golden State Warriors now have a starting five which contains 5 all stars. This has not been done since 1970s when Celtics were dominating. 5 all-stars in the team. What the hell is going on?  What are we supposed to be excited about for the next season? Will the warriors lose at least once in the playoff? \nDemarcus Cousins is the biggest sellout I have ever seen. Even worse than Kevin Durant aka the snake. Cousins joined Pelicans and had a good team around him. He had Rondon, Holiday and Anthony Davis. He was part of a team that won 6th seed in the West and swept the blazers WITHOUT HIM. AD wore his jersey in the All-Star game to show his support for him. What does DC do after all of that? LEAVES TO GSW! Are you kidding me?! What happened to competitive nature of this sport? This has to be the most disrespectful move in NBA history. PATHETIC Demarcus. You are Pathetic.\n\tNBA is in big trouble. Adam Silver needs to do something drastic. This cannot continue anymore! I am so sick of seeing Golden State in the finals and it’s not stopping anytime soon. I don’t know how this can be fixed, but it has to be done. Adam Silver this is your time to shine. You need to come up with a way to stop these superteams. Put 500% tax for every $ that goes over the salary cap, that will stop those damn owners and GMs from overspending.\nIn addition to Golden State dominating for the last 4 years and the foreseeable future the East conference has been garbage for the last 20-30 years. And it is only getting worse every year. The MVP of the last 5 years is from the West. How telling is that? There has been 3 MVP winners from the East in the last 18 years. Iverson, Lebron and D Rose. That is it. And the last team to win NBA championship from the East that does not have Lebron James in the roster was Celtics in 2008. For the last 10 years it was either Lebron or the West. FIX IT NBA! \nI have been thinking about changing the play offs to be Top 16 teams of the regular season despite the conferences, but I don’t know if this drastic change is the right thing to do. The rich history of NBA will be altered forever. The rivalry between the conferences, even though it’s been weak for the last few decades, still has a great appeal for everyone. In addition to this, if no team from the East side of the USA makes the Finals, the appeal of NBA in half of the country will diminish.\nI love NBA. It is the best basketball league in the world with the best players. But what has been going on for the last ten years or so is unacceptable! This needs to be fixed now. NBA is in a desperate need of tough decisions from the executives and especially Mr. Silver. You inherited one of the greatest entertainment business in the world of sports from Mr. Stern.
